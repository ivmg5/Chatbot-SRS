# **Chatbot-SRS Documentation**
> *A comprehensive software requirements analysis for a document management chatbot.*

## **Introduction**
The Chatbot-SRS repository contains a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a planned document management chatbot. This document lays out the technical and functional specifications for a chatbot designed to streamline document management, automate related tasks, and improve operational efficiency in corporate environments. By establishing a foundation of clearly defined requirements, this SRS provides essential guidance for the chatbot’s future development and deployment.

## **Project Description**
- **Purpose of the SRS**: To define the functional and non-functional requirements of a document management chatbot, including the technical scope, limitations, and intended features.
- **Core functionalities**: The chatbot is envisioned to assist users by automating document search, comparison, and retrieval tasks, as well as providing collaborative document access within an organization.
- **Key areas covered**:
  - **Problem Analysis**: Examines the current inefficiencies in document handling and how the chatbot will address these issues.
  - **System Requirements**: Details user interface needs, operational constraints, and required interactions with existing software and hardware systems.
  - **Expected Challenges**: Identifies potential design and operational constraints that may influence the chatbot’s effectiveness.
  - **Future Development**: The SRS will serve as a guiding document for subsequent design, coding, testing, and implementation phases.
